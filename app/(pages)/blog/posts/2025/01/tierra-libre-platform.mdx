Trail running changed my life, but access to trail running does not happen by accident. The outdoors, especially endurance sports, is full of invisible prerequisites: gear knowledge, cultural familiarity, time, mentorship, safety confidence, and psychological permission. A registration code alone does not solve this. Access is not just a transaction. It is an ecosystem.

The question for me as a software engineer became: how do you build software that supports belonging?

Not software for efficiency or scale alone. Software that is relational, slow in the right places, and designed to hold real human stories.

This is the design challenge behind [Tierra Libre Run](https://tierralibre.run), but the approach applies far beyond trail running. Think of this as a blueprint for building community-centered, access-focused platforms for any outdoor or movement-based space.

## Principle 1: Access is a Workflow, Not a Feature

Most access initiatives start with a single point of intervention: a free race entry, a discount code, a donated piece of gear. These are important, but they ignore the path before and after. When building for belonging, you're designing for the whole journey. That means awareness that the activity is for you, confidence that you can show up, logistical and financial support, a community to train with, and integration into ongoing practice.

So the platform needs to function less like a "benefits portal" and more like a guided workflow<Footnote id="guided-workflow">A benefits portal is transactional. You apply, you get approved, you receive a benefit. A guided workflow is relational. It recognizes where you are in your journey, provides appropriate support at each stage, and helps you move forward. The software becomes a companion in the process, not just a tool to extract a benefit. <Image src="/photos/website-photo-1.jpg" alt="Trail running community" width={600} height={400} /></Footnote> The software should shape how someone moves through the sport.

That led us to three core modules. The Funding Module lets athletes submit an application, share their story, and get support. The Mentorship Module pairs them with someone further along in the journey. The Community Events Module enables them to show up locally, repeatedly, and socially.

None of these can stand alone. The product is the connection between them.

## Principle 2: Relationship Data Is Primary Data

The core object in our system is not an "athlete." It is a narrative<Footnote id="narrative-object">This architectural decision shapes everything. If your primary object is an "athlete" with attributes like name, email, race preference, you design forms and workflows around those attributes. If your primary object is a "narrative" with fields like story, journey, barriers, needs, you design forms and workflows around understanding and supporting that narrative.</Footnote>.

The application form is structured to collect stories, not just attributes. We ask why they want to run, where they are in their journey, what barriers they've faced, and what support will actually help.

This isn't optics. It's architecture.

If you treat people as rows in a table, you design software that moves them like rows in a table. If you treat people as stories, the platform becomes a site of recognition rather than extraction.

We use structured fields to enable operations and analytics, but the human layer is non-negotiable. Features are allowed to slow down enough to let meaning form.

## Principle 3: Optimize for Maintainability, Not Viral Scale

There is a trap in "tech for good" where everything gets framed as scaling infinitely. But access ecosystems are inherently relational. They scale like forests, not like servers<Footnote id="forests-not-servers">Forests grow slowly. They require the right conditions. They support diverse ecosystems. They're resilient but not infinitely scalable. Servers scale linearly. You add more servers, you handle more traffic. But communities don't work that way. You can't just add more servers and expect the community to grow. You need to tend to relationships, create the right conditions, and let things grow organically.</Footnote>.

So the technical stack must be modular to evolve as the community evolves, readable so future maintainers can actually work on it, and composable so features expand without rewriting the core.

Our stack uses Next.js for clear routing and server components, PlanetScale for branch-based schema iteration, TypeScript because type safety supports trust, and shadcn/ui for flexible, community-owned design primitives.

We optimize for legibility. A platform meant to serve community should be something the community can someday maintain.

## Principle 4: Partnerships Need Transparency by Design

Outdoor access work is collaborative. Race organizers, brands, volunteers, donors, athletes—all rely on shared accountability. If your system can't explain where support goes, trust breaks.

So reporting is part of the product, not an afterthought<Footnote id="reporting-product">We built reporting features from the beginning, not as an add-on later. Every action in the system generates data that can be reported. Every partnership has a dashboard. Every athlete can see how their story connects to the larger mission. This isn't just about satisfying funders. It's about building a culture of transparency and accountability.</Footnote>.

We built internal views to track who receives funding, summarize demographic and geographic reach, map mentorship networks and outcomes, and generate partner-specific impact summaries automatically.

When partners see clearly, they invest more deeply. When athletes see clearly, they understand they are part of something larger.

## Principle 5: Access Changes Identity, and Identity Changes Design

Once someone runs their first race, the barriers shift. They may now see themselves as a "trail runner." That means the platform must support graduation into leadership, mentorship, and community building.

The system is not only for entry. It is for circulation<Footnote id="circulation-system">A system that only supports entry creates dependency. A system that supports circulation creates community. The goal isn't just to get people into the sport. It's to help them become leaders, mentors, and community builders. This is how access becomes transformation.</Footnote>.

People move from funded to mentored to trained to racing to mentoring to leading. The software's job is to support that circle.

## A Pattern Others Can Use

If you are building software for accessible outdoor spaces, consider designing around these questions. What is the journey into belonging? Design for that. Where are the hidden prerequisites? Name them. What parts should be slow and personal? Protect them. What parts should be automated? Automate only those. How does someone return and lead? Enable that.

This is not just an application platform. It is software as cultural infrastructure.

We are building tools not simply to get people outside, but to reshape who the outdoors is for.
