After setting up countless Next.js projects, I've refined my configuration to maximize type safety and code consistency. Let me walk you through my setup and explain why each option matters.

## TypeScript Configuration That Makes Sense

First, let's look at the `tsconfig.json` that I use in every project:

### Compilation and Environment Settings

```json
{
	"target": "es5",
	"lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
	"module": "esnext",
	"moduleResolution": "node"
}
```

This ensures our code compiles to ES5 for maximum browser compatibility while still allowing us to use modern JavaScript features. The `lib` array gives us access to DOM types and modern JavaScript APIs.

### Type Safety Settings

```json
{
	"strict": false,
	"strictNullChecks": true,
	"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
}
```

Here's where it gets interesting. While I don't enable all strict checks, I specifically want `strictNullChecks` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Let me show you why:

```typescript
// Without noUncheckedIndexedAccess
const users = ['Alice', 'Bob']
const lastUser = users[999] // TypeScript thinks this is string

// With noUncheckedIndexedAccess
const lastUser = users[999] // TypeScript correctly flags this as string | undefined
```

This simple setting has saved me from countless runtime errors.

### Project Structure

```json
{
	"baseUrl": ".",
	"resolveJsonModule": true,
	"jsx": "preserve"
}
```

These settings improve the development experience. `baseUrl` enables absolute imports from the project root, while `resolveJsonModule` lets us import JSON files directly.

## Prettier Configuration: Beyond Basic Formatting

My `.prettierrc` configuration is equally important. Here's why certain settings matter:

### Core Formatting Rules

```json
{
	"singleQuote": true,
	"semi": false,
	"useTabs": true,
	"tabWidth": 2,
	"printWidth": 80
}
```

I prefer single quotes and no semicolons for cleaner code. Tabs over spaces because they're more accessible and allow developers to set their preferred indentation width.

### Tailwind Integration

```json
{
	"plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"],
	"tailwindAttributes": [
		"class",
		"className",
		"ngClass",
		".*[cC]lassName"
	],
	"tailwindFunctions": ["clsx", "cn"]
}
```

This is crucial if you're using Tailwind CSS. The plugin automatically sorts Tailwind classes in a consistent order. I've added support for various class-related attributes and utility functions like `clsx` and `cn`.

### File-Specific Overrides

```json
{
	"overrides": [
		{
			"files": ["**/package.json"],
			"options": {
				"useTabs": false
			}
		},
		{
			"files": ["**/*.mdx"],
			"options": {
				"printWidth": 65,
				"proseWrap": "preserve"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Different files need different formatting. JSON files work better with spaces, and MDX files need special handling for better readability.

## Why This Combination Works

The magic happens when these configurations work together:

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches potential errors before they hit production.
2. **Consistent Styling**: Prettier ensures the codebase looks uniform regardless of who wrote it.
3. **Modern Development**: We get modern features while maintaining compatibility.
4. **Team Friendly**: These settings work well for teams, reducing conflicts and making code reviews easier.

Here's a real-world example showing how these configurations work together:

```typescript
// This code is automatically formatted and type-checked
interface User {
  name: string
  posts?: string[]
}

function getLatestPost(user: User) {
  // TypeScript warns us about possible undefined
  const post = user.posts?.[0]

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-4 hover:bg-gray-100">
      {post && <p>{post}</p>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

The TypeScript configuration ensures we handle nullable values correctly, while Prettier formats the code and sorts Tailwind classes automatically.

## Getting Started

To use these configurations in your project:

1. Copy the `tsconfig.json` content into your project
2. Create a `.prettierrc` file with the provided configuration
3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

That's it! Your Next.js project now has a solid foundation for type-safe, consistently formatted code.
