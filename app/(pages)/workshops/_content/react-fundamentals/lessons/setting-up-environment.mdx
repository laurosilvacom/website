Before we start building React applications, we need to set up our development environment. This lesson will guide you through installing the necessary tools and creating your first React project.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js installed on your computer (version 14 or higher)
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code)

## Installing Node.js and npm

If you haven't already installed Node.js, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which we'll use to manage our project dependencies.

Verify your installation by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Creating a New React Project

We'll use Create React App, which sets up a React project with a good default configuration:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
npm start
```

This will create a new React application and start a development server. You should see your app running at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Exploring the Project Structure

Let's take a look at the key files in our new project:

- `public/index.html`: The HTML template for your app
- `src/index.js`: The JavaScript entry point
- `src/App.js`: A simple React component
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts

## Making Your First Change

Open `src/App.js` and modify the return statement:

```jsx
function App() {
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<header className="App-header">
				<h1>Hello from my first React app!</h1>
				<p>I'm learning React fundamentals</p>
			</header>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Save the file and see the changes automatically reflected in your browser.

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into React components and props.
