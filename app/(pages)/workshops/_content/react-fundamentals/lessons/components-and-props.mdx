Components are the building blocks of React applications. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

## What Are Components?

In React, a component is a JavaScript function or class that optionally accepts inputs (called "props") and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page. Breaking your UI into components allows you to:

- Reuse UI elements across your application
- Keep related code together
- Test individual parts of your UI in isolation
- Develop parts of your application independently

## Functional Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
	return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
}
```

This is a functional component that returns a simple heading element. To use this component in your application, you would write:

```jsx
<Greeting />
```

## Props: Component Inputs

Components often need to be customizable. This is where props come in. Props (short for "properties") are inputs that you pass to a component.

Let's modify our Greeting component to accept a `name` prop:

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
	return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
}
```

Now we can use it like this:

```jsx
<Greeting name="Alice" />  // Renders: Hello, Alice!
<Greeting name="Bob" />    // Renders: Hello, Bob!
```

## Destructuring Props

For cleaner code, it's common to destructure props:

```jsx
function Greeting({name, role = 'user'}) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
			<p>Role: {role}</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Notice how we've also provided a default value for the `role` prop.

## Props Are Read-Only

In React, components must never modify their own props. Props flow down from parent to child, and this one-way data flow makes your application more predictable and easier to understand.

## Composing Components

The true power of components comes from composition - building complex UIs by combining simpler components:

```jsx
function Avatar({user}) {
	return <img src={user.avatarUrl} alt={user.name} />
}

function UserInfo({user}) {
	return (
		<div className="user-info">
			<Avatar user={user} />
			<div className="user-info-name">{user.name}</div>
		</div>
	)
}

function Comment({author, text}) {
	return (
		<div className="comment">
			<UserInfo user={author} />
			<div className="comment-text">{text}</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

This pattern of composition creates a clean separation of concerns and makes your components more reusable.

## Children Props

React has a special prop called `children` that allows components to accept arbitrary content:

```jsx
function Card({title, children}) {
	return (
		<div className="card">
			<h2>{title}</h2>
			<div className="card-content">{children}</div>
		</div>
	)
}

// Usage
;<Card title="Welcome">
	<p>This is some content inside the card.</p>
	<button>Click me!</button>
</Card>
```

The `children` prop gives you incredible flexibility when designing reusable components.

## Exercises

1. Create a `Button` component that accepts `text`, `onClick`, and `disabled` props
2. Create a `UserProfile` component that displays a user's name, email, and avatar
3. Create a `Container` component that wraps its children with consistent padding and a border

In the next lesson, we'll explore state and effects, which will allow our components to be dynamic and respond to user interactions.
