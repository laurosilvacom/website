## Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of our AI-powered web applications workshop! Before we dive into building our chat interface, we need to set up our development environment with all the necessary tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Creating a new Next.js project

We'll start by creating a new Next.js project with the App Router:

```bash
npx create-next-app ai-chat-app
```

When prompted, select the following options:

- TypeScript: Yes
- ESLint: Yes
- Tailwind CSS: Yes
- App Router: Yes
- Import alias: Yes (default @/\*)

## Installing additional dependencies

Navigate to your project folder and install the required packages:

```bash
cd ai-chat-app
npm install ai @vercel/ai lucide-react class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge
```

## Setting up UI components

We'll use shadcn/ui for our component library. Initialize it with:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

When prompted, choose:

- TypeScript: Yes
- Style: Default (or your preference)
- Base color: Slate (or your preference)
- Global CSS path: app/globals.css
- CSS variables: Yes
- React Server Components: Yes
- Components location: @/components
- Utilities location: @/lib/utils

## Adding essential components

Let's add some components we'll need:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input card textarea avatar
```

## Project structure

Create the following folder structure:

```
app/
├── api/
│   └── chat/
│       └── route.ts
├── chat/
│   └── page.tsx
├── page.tsx
components/
├── chat/
│   ├── chat-input.tsx
│   ├── chat-message.tsx
│   └── chat-window.tsx
```

## Setting up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Conclusion

Your development environment is now set up! In the next lesson, we'll start building the UI scaffolding for our AI chat interface.
