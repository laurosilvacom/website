### ðŸ§  Introduction

Now that you've created a beautiful UI with v0.dev, let's implement it in a real Next.js application. In this exercise, you'll set up a new project and integrate your AI-generated interface.

### Understanding Component Libraries

Before we begin, it's worth understanding what makes this possible. Tools like v0.dev generate UIs using component libraries like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), which provide:

- **Reusable, customizable components** - Not a traditional library, but a collection of components you own
- **Open code** - The component code is yours to modify and adapt
- **Composition-based design** - Components work together predictably
- **AI-friendly architecture** - Perfect for tools like v0.dev to work with

This approach allows us to generate entire interfaces and easily integrate them into our applications.

### ðŸ’ª Exercise: Implementing Your AI UI

#### Step 1: Create a New Next.js App

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-ai-chat-app
cd my-ai-chat-app
```

Answer the setup questions (TypeScript is recommended).

#### Step 2: Add Your Generated UI

You have two options:

**Option A: Use your own v0.dev design**

- Copy the URL of your v0.dev design
- Run this command (replace with your URL):

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add "https://v0.dev/your-design-url"
```

**Option B: Use my prepared design**

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add "https://v0.dev/chat/b/OBe14oxHJLs?token=eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIn0..ZO1dnPhDCSdqtJUb.m_sUpPAbMYwQ_q12PT2bbmnJlgPfTtPWjMLH5IiqaX_CnkZdm_dlW33n.9alxUWbOG8zslDZEgQY3ug"
```

#### Step 3: Run Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```
