### üåü Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Powered Chat Application Workshop! Before we dive in, let's quickly cover how this workshop is structured so you can get the most out of it.

### üìö Workshop Structure

Each lesson follows a consistent three-part format:

1. **Introduction**: We'll explain key concepts and set up the context for what you'll be learning.

2. **Exercise**: You'll work on hands-on challenges to apply what you've learned. These exercises are designed to be challenging and not necessarily meant to be finished in one sitting.

3. **Solution**: We'll walk through a complete solution together, explaining the reasoning behind implementation choices.

The workshop is divided into four modules:

- Module 1: UI Scaffolding of AI Chat Interface (60m)
- Module 2: AI SDK Implementation (50m)
- Module 3: Building Dynamic Chat Interfaces (60m)
- Module 4: Advanced Features and Deployment (60m)

### üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have created a fully functional AI chat interface with advanced features. We'll start with building a UI, implement AI functionality, add dynamic elements, and finally deploy a production-ready application.

### üí° Learning Approach

Our approach emphasizes practical skills through hands-on coding. We'll leverage modern AI tools not just as the subject of our study, but also to accelerate our development workflow.

Let's get started with our first lesson!
