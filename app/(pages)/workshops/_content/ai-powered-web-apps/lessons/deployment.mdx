### üéØ Introduction

After building your AI-powered application, the next step is to share it with the world. Deployment makes your application accessible to users beyond your local development environment. In this lesson, we'll deploy our AI chat application to Vercel, a platform perfectly suited for Next.js applications with AI functionality.

### üöÄ Why Vercel for AI Applications?

Vercel offers several advantages for AI-powered applications:

1. **Optimized for Next.js**: Since Vercel created Next.js, the platform provides excellent support for its features
2. **Edge Functions**: Essential for streaming AI responses efficiently
3. **Environment Variables**: Secure storage for your API keys
4. **Serverless Architecture**: Scales automatically with demand
5. **Vercel AI SDK Integration**: Built with Vercel's AI SDK in mind

### üíª Prerequisites for Deployment

Before deploying, make sure you have:

1. **A GitHub repository** with your application code
2. **A Vercel account** (free to create at vercel.com)
3. **API keys** for any AI services you're using (OpenAI, etc.)

### üõ†Ô∏è Preparing Your Application for Deployment

#### Step 1: Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project if you haven't already:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This file should be included in your `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information:

```
# .gitignore
.env
.env.local
```

#### Step 2: Check for Environment Variable Usage

Review your code to ensure you're using `process.env` to access environment variables:

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
const openai = createOpenAI({
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
})
```

#### Step 3: Commit Your Code to GitHub

If you haven't already, push your code to a GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push
```

### üö¢ Deploying with Vercel CLI

The Vercel CLI offers a quick way to deploy directly from your terminal:

#### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

#### Step 2: Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

#### Step 3: Deploy Your Application

From your project directory, run:

```bash
vercel
```

The CLI will guide you through a series of questions:

- **Set up and deploy?** Yes
- **Link to existing project?** No (for first deployment)
- **Project name:** Choose a name or accept the default
- **Root directory:** `./` (the current directory)

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

After initial deployment, you'll need to set up your environment variables:

```bash
vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted. By default, this adds the variable to all environments (production, preview, and development).

#### Step 5: Deploy with Environment Variables

Re-deploy your application to apply the environment variables:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### üîÑ Continuous Deployment

For future updates, you can:

1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Vercel will automatically deploy the changes (if you've set up GitHub integration)

Or manually deploy with:

```bash
vercel --prod
```
