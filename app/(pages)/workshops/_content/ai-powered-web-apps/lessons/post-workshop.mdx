### üéØ Introduction

Congratulations on completing the AI-Powered Web Applications workshop! Now that you've built a functional AI chat application, it's time to take your skills further with some real-world challenges. These projects will help you solidify what you've learned and expand your application with professional features.

### üèÜ Challenge 1: Implement Dynamic Chat Routing

**Goal:** Replace the static chat data with a dynamic system that creates and manages chat sessions.

**What you'll learn:**

- Dynamic route handling in Next.js
- State management for chat sessions
- URL parameter handling

**Key implementation areas:**

- Create a database model for chat sessions
- Implement `/chat/[id]` dynamic routing
- Add functionality to create new chats
- Develop a chat history sidebar that updates in real-time

**Resources:**

- [Next.js Dynamic Routes Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)
- [SWR for data fetching](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [Using route handlers in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)

**Difficulty:** Moderate

### üèÜ Challenge 2: Add Authentication with Clerk

**Goal:** Implement user authentication so each user has their own private chats.

**What you'll learn:**

- Integrating third-party authentication
- Protecting routes and API endpoints
- User-specific data management

**Key implementation areas:**

- Set up Clerk authentication
- Create protected routes
- Associate chats with specific users
- Filter chat history by authenticated user
- Handle guest vs. authenticated experiences

**Resources:**

- [Clerk Documentation](https://clerk.com/docs)
- [Next.js Authentication Patterns](https://nextjs.org/docs/authentication)
- [Protecting API Routes in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#request-helpers)

**Difficulty:** Moderate

### üèÜ Challenge 3: Implement Database Storage for Chats

**Goal:** Set up a database to persistently store chat conversations and user data.

**What you'll learn:**

- Database integration with Next.js
- Data modeling for chat applications
- Efficient data querying patterns

**Key implementation areas:**

- Choose a database (Supabase, Prisma with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Design schemas for users, chats, and messages
- Implement CRUD operations for chat history
- Add real-time updates for active chats
- Develop pagination for long chat histories

**Resources:**

- [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs)
- [Prisma Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)
- [MongoDB Atlas Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/)
- [Vercel Postgres Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres)

These challenges are designed to push your skills further while building practical features that real-world applications need. You don't need to implement them all at once - pick the one that interests you most or meets your immediate needs.

Good luck!
