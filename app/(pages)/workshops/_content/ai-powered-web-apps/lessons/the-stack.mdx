### üèóÔ∏è Introduction

Before diving into code, let's understand the technology stack we'll use to build our AI-powered chat application. Our goal is to demystify AI development by showing how accessible it can be with the right tools.

AI technologies might seem complex and intimidating, but modern frameworks and SDKs have made it easier than ever to integrate powerful AI capabilities into web applications. You don't need to be an AI researcher to build sophisticated AI-powered products!

Our stack consists of three main components:

1. **Next.js** - A React framework that provides structure, routing, and server capabilities
2. **React** - For building our interactive UI components
3. **Vercel AI SDK** - The key ingredient that simplifies working with AI models

### üìã The Vercel AI SDK

The AI SDK is a TypeScript toolkit specifically designed to help developers like us build AI-powered applications. It works seamlessly with React, Next.js, and other frameworks.

What makes this SDK valuable:

- It standardizes how we integrate AI models from different providers
- It handles streaming responses elegantly
- It provides React hooks for easy integration
- It manages the complex parts of AI implementation so we can focus on building features

This means we can spend our time creating valuable user experiences rather than wrestling with API peculiarities or response handling.

### üß© Prerequisites and Learning Focus

For this workshop, you should have:

- Basic JavaScript knowledge
- Some familiarity with React components
- General web development understanding

Don't worry if you're not an AI expert - that's precisely the point! We'll show you how to leverage AI capabilities without needing specialized AI knowledge.

### üöÄ What We're Building

Our goal is to create a full-stack application with AI at its center. This means:

- A responsive, intuitive chat interface (frontend)
- AI-powered conversation capabilities (backend integration)
- Proper handling of streaming responses
- User-friendly features like message history

### üí° The AI Simplicity Principle

One key takeaway from this workshop is that AI implementation doesn't have to be complex. The right abstractions (like the AI SDK) allow us to focus on what matters - building features users will love.
