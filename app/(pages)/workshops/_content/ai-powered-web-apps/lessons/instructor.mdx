### Beyond Coding

When I'm not coding or teaching, I enjoy running in the
mountains of the Pacific Northwest as a trail runner.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Workshop Approach

Throughout this workshop, I'll share my practical teaching style that combines real-world examples with clear explanations. My goal is to make AI development accessible and enjoyable while giving you skills you can immediately apply to your own projects.

    I've seen many developers struggle with integrating AI into
    their applications. This workshop is designed to demystify AI
    development and show you how accessible it can be with the
    right tools and approach.

Let's start building something amazing together!
