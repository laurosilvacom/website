### üéØ Introduction

In our previous lesson, we explored the AI SDK's core components. Now, let's focus on one of its most powerful features: Tools. Tools extend what an AI can do by giving it access to external data and capabilities. In this lesson, we'll create a GitHub profile tool that developers will find genuinely useful.

### üîß Understanding AI Tools

Tools are functions that an AI can invoke when appropriate. Each tool has three key components:

1. **Description** - Helps the AI understand when to use the tool
2. **Parameters** - Defines what inputs the tool needs (using Zod for validation)
3. **Execute function** - The actual code that runs when the tool is called

### üíª Creating a GitHub Profile Tool

Let's implement a simple tool to fetch GitHub profile information:

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import {createOpenAI} from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import {streamText} from 'ai'
import {z} from 'zod'

const openai = createOpenAI({
	apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
})

export async function POST(req: Request) {
	const {messages} = await req.json()

	const result = streamText({
		model: openai('gpt-4o'),
		messages,
		tools: {
			getGitHubProfile: {
				description:
					'Get public information about a GitHub user profile',
				parameters: z.object({
					username: z
						.string()
						.describe('The GitHub username to look up')
				}),
				execute: async ({username}) => {
					try {
						const response = await fetch(
							`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`
						)

						if (!response.ok) {
							return {
								error: `Failed to fetch profile: ${response.status}`
							}
						}

						const data = await response.json()

						return {
							login: data.login,
							name: data.name,
							bio: data.bio,
							public_repos: data.public_repos,
							followers: data.followers,
							html_url: data.html_url
						}
					} catch (error) {
						return {error: 'Failed to fetch GitHub profile'}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	})

	return result.toDataStreamResponse()
}
```

### üß† How Tools Work: The Flow

Understanding the flow of tool usage is essential:

1. **User asks a question** - "What can you tell me about the GitHub user vercel?"
2. **AI identifies tool need** - The model recognizes it needs GitHub profile data
3. **AI selects parameters** - It extracts "vercel" as the username
4. **Tool execution** - The execute function runs on the server
5. **Result returned** - The GitHub profile data is returned to the model
6. **AI formulates response** - The model creates a response using the profile data

### üîë Key Concepts for Building Tools

When building AI tools, remember these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each tool should do one thing well
2. **Clear Description** - Help the AI understand when to use the tool
3. **Precise Parameters** - Define exactly what inputs the tool needs
4. **Error Handling** - Handle API failures and edge cases gracefully
5. **Return Structured Data** - Make the data easy for the AI to use

### üåê When to Use Tools vs. Embeddings

It's important to understand when to use tools versus other techniques:

| Use Tools When                 | Use Embeddings (RAG) When              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Accessing real-time data       | Working with static documents          |
| Performing calculations        | Searching through knowledge bases      |
| Interacting with external APIs | Personalizing responses with user data |
| Running specific functions     | Handling domain-specific terminology   |

### üöÄ Enabling Multi-Step Tool Calls

To make tools truly useful, we need to enable multi-step execution:

```typescript
// In your chat component
const chatOptions = useChat({
	initialMessages,
	maxSteps: 5 // Allow up to 5 tool calls in one interaction
})
```

The `maxSteps` parameter allows the AI to:

1. Call a tool
2. Process the result
3. Potentially call another tool based on that result

Without this, tools would be limited to a single invocation without follow-up.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Development Best Practices

1. **Validate Inputs** - Use Zod to ensure parameters are correct
2. **Handle Rate Limits** - External APIs often have usage limits
3. **Keep Tools Focused** - Create multiple specialized tools rather than one complex tool
4. **Return Useful Errors** - Error messages should help diagnose problems
5. **Consider Caching** - Cache results when appropriate to improve performance

### üí° Tool Ideas for Developers

Besides GitHub profiles, consider these developer-focused tools:

1. **Package Info** - Fetch NPM/PyPI package details and documentation
2. **Code Explanation** - Analyze code snippets from repositories
3. **API Status** - Check if popular developer services are operational
4. **DNS Lookup** - Perform domain name lookups
5. **Syntax Reference** - Retrieve language syntax examples

### üéØ Conclusion

Tools transform an AI chat interface from a simple text generator into a capable assistant that can interact with external systems. The key takeaways from this lesson:

1. **Tools extend AI capabilities** by giving access to external data and functions
2. **The tool structure** consists of description, parameters, and an execute function
3. **Multi-step execution** enables complex interactions and follow-up questions
4. **Error handling** ensures a smooth experience even when external systems fail
5. **Developer tools** like our GitHub profile tool create practical utility

In the next lesson, we'll explore how to enhance our user interface to better display tool results, making them more visually informative and useful.
