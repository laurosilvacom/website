I recently had the incredible opportunity to attend Footprints Camp, an experience that has fundamentally changed how I approach my career, work, and passion for trail running.

In this article, I’ll share my experience at Footprints Camp, what the camp experience is like, the insights I gained, and details about the community climate action project that I decided to work on during the camp.

A special thank you to Ryan Thrower for capturing the essence of our experience through his incredible photography. The images included in this blog post truly showcase the spirit and fun we had at Footprints Camp.

## More Than Just a Running Camp

While my days were filled with breathtaking runs on the beautiful fall trails of Vermont, the true journey lay in the profound insights I gained about social and environmental justice. I discovered how deeply these issues are intertwined with capitalist and colonial systems, providing me with a new lens through which to view my role as both a runner and an individual on this planet.

## What is Footprints Camp?

Footprints Camp is a unique experience that's challenging to fully encapsulate. At its core, it brings together 10 individuals, known as campers, to each develop and collaborate on their own community-driven climate action project over the course of a week.

The camp provides access to incredible mentors, their expertise, and valuable resources, all aimed at helping you leverage your unique experiences, skills, and knowledge to craft a meaningful climate action initiative within your community.

Held at the Craftsbury Outdoor Center in Craftsbury Common, Vermont, the location is nothing short of extraordinary. This special place offers comfortable indoor accommodations, delicious meals, and, importantly, access to a vast network of trails for running. It’s an environment that blends learning, reflection, and action, making Footprints Camp a truly one-of-a-kind experience.

## The Camp Curriculum

At Footprints Camp, we embarked on a journey of profound learning and unlearning, with a curriculum centered around the crucial idea of creating an equitable and sustainable future for everyone—_emphasis on everyone_.

One of the most impactful resources was the reading list, featuring **_The Intersectional Environmentalist_** by _Leah Thomas_.

Thomas's book offers a vital premise: true environmentalism cannot exist without acknowledging the intersections of racism, privilege, and environmental degradation.

It underscores a fundamental truth—we cannot save our planet without amplifying the voices of its people, especially those who are marginalized and often unheard. She persuasively argues that the struggle for environmental protection is intricately linked with the fight for civil rights; one cannot truly succeed without the other.

These insights (and more) laid the foundation for crafting my community climate action project.

## Community Climate Action Projects

A community climate action project can take many forms, but its core premise is that it must be tailored to the specific needs of the community it aims to serve. At Footprints Camp, each camper developed a unique project designed to make a meaningful impact on both people and their environment.

One of my key takeaways from building my project was realizing that:

> **Climate action must be equitable to be considered true action**

This equity is achieved in various ways, one of which is grounding the projects in the values set by Footprints: accessibility, collectivity, compassion, confidence, humility, reciprocity, and resilience.

## Tierra Libre Run

My project is **Tierra Libre**—meaning "Free Land" in Spanish, pays homage to my heritage and Mexican indigenous culture.

Our mission is simple yet impactful:

> **To create equitable access to nature, and enhance access to public lands for the BIPOC community in Portland, all through the transformative experience of trail running.**

Looking to the future, we plan to organize BIPOC-only runs, barrier-free outdoor events, and a **BIPOC Athlete Retreat** at Mt. Hood in 2025. The retreat aims to empower underrepresented athletes by providing a safe and supportive environment for them to connect with nature, heal in community, and expand their role in the outdoors.

After attending Footprints and reflecting on my personal experience in trail running, I've come to understand that real inclusion involves offering tangible support—such as financial aid and access to resources—but most importantly, it requires a community that celebrates and amplifies the diverse stories and backgrounds of people.

This is the essence of our running camp and the heart of Tierra Libre.

## Thank You Note

I left the camp with my goals fulfilled, my spirit expanded, and a deep understanding, thanks to the campers who attended and the amazing mentors and staff.

A heartfelt thanks to the mentors: **Jon Jon Moore**, **Adeline Thompson**, **Dr. Brianna Pagán**, **Peter Schlachte**, **Brittany Blitzer**, **Dakota Jones**, and **Ryan Thrower**. Without each of them, this camp wouldn't have been as special. Their support, generosity, and presence made a significant impact on my experience, and they have inspired me in countless ways.

I cannot forget to mention all the people at **Craftsbury** who provided the space, prepared our meals, and cared for the outdoors. This place will hold a special place in my heart and will influence how I approach my future endeavors in outdoor spaces.
