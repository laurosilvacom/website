Over the years, I've received countless requests from friends and clients seeking guidance on building simple websites. While they don't need complex, production-grade applications, they do want to establish their online presence effectively. This guide distills my experience into practical steps for non-developers â€“ whether you're a small business owner, creative professional, or anyone looking to create a website without diving deep into web development.

## Securing Your Domain Name

The foundation of any website begins with a domain name - your unique address on the internet. While many website builders offer domain registration services, I recommend purchasing your domain separately for greater flexibility and control. After a decade of experience, I've found Namecheap.com to be the most reliable domain registrar.

Essential Steps When Purchasing:

1. Choose your registration period (minimum one year)
2. Skip unnecessary add-ons, except for ICANN fees which are mandatory
3. Enable two-factor authentication immediately for security

Pro Tip: For hobby projects, start with a one-year registration. You can always renew or extend later as your project grows.

## Notion

Not every project requires a full-fledged website builder. When you need to share organized information in a professional format, Notion offers an excellent middle ground. It's more polished than a Google Doc but simpler than a traditional website.

What makes Notion stand out:

- Powerful data organization tools
- Public page publishing feature
- Custom domain support
- Built-in hierarchy for pages and sub-pages

## Framer - a website builder that has a good design

## React Frameworks

## Deploying your Websites

## AI tools to help you make improvements
