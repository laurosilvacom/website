Over the years, I've received countless requests from friends and clients seeking guidance on building simple websites. While they don't need complex, production-grade applications, they do want to establish their online presence effectively. This guide distills my experience into practical steps for non-developers â€“ whether you're a small business owner, creative professional, or anyone looking to create a website without diving deep into web development.

## Securing Your Domain Name

The foundation of any website begins with a domain name - your unique address on the internet. While many website builders offer domain registration services, I recommend purchasing your domain separately for greater flexibility and control. After a decade of experience, I've found Namecheap.com to be the most reliable domain registrar.

Essential Steps When Purchasing:

1. Choose your registration period (minimum one year)
2. Skip unnecessary add-ons, except for ICANN fees which are mandatory
3. Enable two-factor authentication immediately for security

Pro Tip: For hobby projects, start with a one-year registration. You can always renew or extend later as your project grows.
