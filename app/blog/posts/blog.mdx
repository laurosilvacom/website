create a new next.js app

```bash
$ npx create-next-app@latest website
```

We want to use Tailwind CSS v4. If youâ€™d like to try upgrading a project from v3 to the v4 beta releases, you can use our upgrade tool to do the vast majority of the heavy lifting for you:

```bash
$ npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next
```

Let's use pnpm

```bash
$ pnpm i
```

let's deploy this application but first commit

```bash
$ gh repo create
```
