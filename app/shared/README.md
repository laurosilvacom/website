# Shared

Reusable cross-feature code.

- `components/`: app-level reusable components
- `ui/`: design-system primitives
- `lib/`: generic helpers
- `hooks/`: reusable hooks
- `integrations/`: third-party adapters (Sanity, Resend, etc.)

If logic is domain-specific, it should move to `app/features/*`.
